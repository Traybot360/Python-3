# Texter Program 

```stmplib```

## Description

This python program gives the user an option of carriers to choose from and the number of the person its too. After the input it sends and email to the number you texted. It's able to do this beacuse every phone number has an email and the email varies depending on the carrier, some carriers don't work ex. Rogers and I still need to add more carriers.



## Params

1.  The phone number you're sending the text to
2.  Your email
3.  The persons carrier
4.  The content that you want to text
5.  Your email password (the password is not covered)
